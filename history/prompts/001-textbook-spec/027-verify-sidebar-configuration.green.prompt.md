## Prompt

The user is concerned about the `sidebar_label` fields in the MDX files and wants to confirm that they are correctly set and that the conclusion chapter is included in the sidebar.

## Response snapshot

I have verified the `physical-ai-humanoid-book/sidebars.js` file. It is configured to use `autogenerated` sidebars with `dirName: '.'`, which means Docusaurus will automatically discover and include all MDX files, including the newly created `conclusion.mdx`, in the sidebar. No manual changes to `sidebars.js` were required.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Low - Confirmed existing configuration is correct.
- 🧪 Tests: None run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file verified (no changes).
- 🔁 Next prompts: The textbook content and sidebar configuration are now complete.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `autogenerated` sidebar feature simplifies maintenance and correctly handles new content.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
