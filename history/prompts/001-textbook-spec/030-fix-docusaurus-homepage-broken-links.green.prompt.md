## Prompt

The user reports that the homepage is "not working properly" and specifically mentions "the link of get started is not working".

## Response snapshot

I have investigated and fixed the broken links on the Docusaurus homepage. The core issue was that the category pages for Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3 were not properly generated by Docusaurus, causing links pointing to them to fail.

To resolve this, I have:
- Updated `physical-ai-humanoid-book/docs/unit-1/_category_.json` to include a `generated-index` link type.
- Updated `physical-ai-humanoid-book/docs/unit-2/_category_.json` to include a `generated-index` link type.
- Updated `physical-ai-humanoid-book/docs/unit-3/_category_.json` to include a `generated-index` link type.

These changes ensure that the target pages for the homepage's "Get Started" button and the "Chapters & Units" section now exist and are correctly linked. The Docusaurus build now completes with only a minor, non-critical warning.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High - Critical broken links on the homepage have been resolved, making the site navigable.
- 🧪 Tests: No explicit tests were run, but the successful Docusaurus build verifies the fix.
- 📁 Files: 3 `_category_.json` files were modified, and `docusaurus.config.js`, `Hero.js`, `Chapters.js`, `CTA.js` are listed as relevant context.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Offer to commit the changes to Git.
- 🧠 Reflection: Ensuring correct Docusaurus category page generation is vital for navigable links, especially when referencing `category` URLs.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Broken links on homepage due to ungenerated category index pages.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
