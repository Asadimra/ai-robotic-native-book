## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:
- Understand the primary motivations and improvements of ROS 2 compared to ROS 1.
- Define what a ROS 2 node is and its role in a robotic system.
- Explain the concept of ROS 2 topics and message passing.
- Differentiate between publishers and subscribers and describe their interaction using text diagrams.

## The Evolution: From ROS 1 to ROS 2

ROS 1, released in 2007, revolutionized robotics development, but as robotics evolved, certain limitations became apparent, especially concerning embedded systems, multi-robot coordination, and real-time performance. ROS 2 was developed to address these challenges with a re-architected core.

**Key improvements in ROS 2:**
-   **Distributed Data Service (DDS):** ROS 2 uses DDS as its communication layer, providing better Quality of Service (QoS) settings, enhanced security, and native support for discovery in distributed environments.
-   **Real-time support:** Designed to better accommodate real-time operating systems (RTOS), crucial for applications requiring precise timing.
-   **Multi-robot systems:** Easier to manage and scale across multiple robots.
-   **Embedded systems:** More efficient for resource-constrained hardware.
-   **Security:** Built-in security features for communication.

## Core Concepts of ROS 2

ROS 2 provides several fundamental concepts that form the backbone of robot software architecture.

### Nodes: The Building Blocks

A **node** is an executable process that performs computations. In ROS 2, every functional component of your robot software (e.g., a camera driver, a motor controller, a navigation algorithm) is typically encapsulated within its own node. This modularity allows for:
-   **Isolation:** If one node crashes, it ideally doesn't bring down the entire system.
-   **Parallelism:** Nodes can run concurrently, even on different machines.
-   **Reusability:** Nodes can be developed and tested independently and reused in various projects.

```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
|  Camera Node     |     |  Motor Control   |     |  Navigation      |
| (Perception)     |     | (Actuation)      |     | (Decision-Making)|
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
```

### Topics: Asynchronous Data Streaming

**Topics** are the most common way for nodes to exchange data in ROS 2. They provide a mechanism for asynchronous, many-to-many communication using a **publish/subscribe** model.

-   **Publisher:** A node that sends messages to a topic.
-   **Subscriber:** A node that receives messages from a topic.

When a node publishes a message to a topic, any node subscribed to that topic will receive a copy of the message. This is ideal for streaming data, such as sensor readings (e.g., camera images, LiDAR scans) or continuous robot states (e.g., odometry).

**Example: A Robot Sending Odometry Data**

```
+---------------+        +------------------+        +---------------+
|               |        |                  |        |               |
| Odometry Node |------->| /robot/odom      |------->| Visualization |
| (Publisher)   |  (Message: Robot Pose)   |        | Node          |
|               |        | (Topic)          |        | (Subscriber)  |
+---------------+        +------------------+        +---------------+
        |                                                    ^
        |                                                    |
        |----------------------------------------------------|
                                                             |
                                                       +---------------+
                                                       |               |
                                                       | Navigation    |
                                                       | Node          |
                                                       | (Subscriber)  |
                                                       +---------------+
```
In this diagram, the "Odometry Node" publishes the robot's pose to the `/robot/odom` topic. Both the "Visualization Node" and the "Navigation Node" subscribe to this topic to receive the robot's current position and orientation.

### Messages: The Data Format

**Messages** are structured data types used to send information over topics, services, and actions. Each message has a predefined type (e.g., `sensor_msgs/msg/Image`, `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`). This ensures that all nodes communicating via a specific topic understand the format of the data being exchanged. Messages are defined in `.msg` files and automatically generate code in various programming languages.

## Summary

This lesson introduced the core differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2, emphasizing ROS 2's advancements in distributed communication and real-time capabilities. We then delved into fundamental ROS 2 concepts: **nodes** as modular computational units and **topics** for asynchronous data streaming using the **publish/subscribe** model. Understanding these concepts is vital for building any ROS 2-based robotic system, forming the basis for how different parts of a robot's software communicate and cooperate.
