## Lesson 1.1.1: Introduction to Physical AI

### Explanations

Physical AI is an interdisciplinary field that combines artificial intelligence with robotics and embodied systems. It focuses on developing intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI systems interact with their environment through sensors and actuators, enabling them to perform tasks in real-world scenarios. This textbook will explore the fundamental concepts, technologies, and applications of Physical AI, with a particular focus on humanoid robotics.

### Examples

Consider a robotic arm programmed to pick up objects. A purely software-based AI might analyze an image of the object and determine its coordinates. A Physical AI system, however, would also consider factors like the arm's current position, joint angles, and the force required to grasp the object.

```python
# Pseudo-code for a simple Physical AI task: object grasping
def grasp_object(object_position, current_arm_position):
    # Use sensors to perceive object and arm position
    # Plan a trajectory for the arm to reach the object
    # Actuate motors to move the arm
    # Use force sensors to detect successful grasp
    print(f"Grasping object at {object_position} from {current_arm_position}")
    # ... more complex logic ...

grasp_object("table_center", "arm_rest_position")
```
This example demonstrates the integration of perception, planning, and action in a physical system. The AI's decision-making is directly coupled with its physical interaction capabilities.
