## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:
- Understand how to break a large robotics project into manageable milestones.
- Design a high-level system architecture for your capstone project.
- Create a clear workflow diagram for your project.

## Introduction: From Plan to Action

You have a project proposal, a clear goal, and a set of requirements. Now it's time to build! This chapter provides a roadmap for executing your capstone project, from breaking down the work into manageable pieces to preparing for your final demonstration. A structured approach to implementation is key to managing complexity and ensuring you stay on track.

## Breaking the Project into Milestones

A large robotics project can feel overwhelming. The best way to tackle it is to break it down into smaller, achievable **milestones**. A milestone is a significant checkpoint that represents the completion of a major part of your project. This allows you to focus on one piece at a time and provides a clear sense of progress.

A typical project workflow can be broken down as follows:

1.  **Milestone 1: Basic Setup & Teleoperation:**
    -   Assemble hardware.
    -   Install all necessary software (OS, ROS 2, simulators).
    -   Get the robot moving with direct manual control (e.g., a keyboard or joystick). This confirms your basic hardware and communication setup is working.

2.  **Milestone 2: Simulation & Perception:**
    -   Create a simulated version of your robot and environment (e.g., in Gazebo).
    -   Implement the core perception task (e.g., write the code to detect a colored object with a camera).

3.  **Milestone 3: Basic Autonomous Action:**
    -   Integrate your perception module with your control module.
    -   Achieve a single, simple autonomous behavior (e.g., make the robot move towards the detected object).

4.  **Milestone 4: Full Task Execution:**
    -   Implement the complete end-to-end logic for your main goal (e.g., navigate to, pick up, and return the object).

5.  **Milestone 5: Testing, Tuning, and Documentation:**
    -   Rigorously test your system, fix bugs, and tune parameters for better performance.
    -   Write your final report and prepare your demonstration.

## Designing a System Architecture

Before you write a single line of complex code, you should have a clear **system architecture**. This is a high-level diagram showing the main software components (e.g., ROS 2 nodes) and how they connect and communicate with each other.

**Example: System Architecture for an Autonomous Fetch-Bot**

```
+-----------+     /camera/image    +--------------+    /object_location   +-------------+
| Camera    |--------------------->|  Object      |--------------------->|  Navigation |
| Node      |      (Sensor Msg)    |  Detector    |     (Point Msg)      |  Goal       |
+-----------+                      |  Node        |                      |  Setter     |
                                   +--------------+                      +-------------+
                                                                                |
                                                                                | /goal_pose
                                                                                v
                                                                          +-------------+
                                                                          |   ROS 2     |
                                                                          |   Nav2      |
                                                                          |   Stack     |
                                                                          +-------------+
                                                                                |
                                                                                | /cmd_vel
                                                                                v
                                                                          +-------------+
                                                                          | Robot       |
                                                                          | Controller  |
                                                                          +-------------+
```
This diagram clearly shows:
-   **Nodes:** The distinct software modules (Camera, Detector, Goal Setter, etc.).
-   **Topics:** The channels they use to communicate (e.g., `/camera/image`).
-   **Data Flow:** How information flows from sensors through processing nodes to actuators.

Having an architecture diagram helps you organize your code, understand dependencies, and allows team members to work on different components in parallel.

## Summary

In this lesson, we laid the foundation for successful project execution. We learned how to break a large project into manageable **milestones** to ensure steady progress. We also covered the importance of designing a clear **system architecture** to map out the software components and data flow of your robotic system. This structured approach is essential for managing complexity and building a robust and functional robot.
