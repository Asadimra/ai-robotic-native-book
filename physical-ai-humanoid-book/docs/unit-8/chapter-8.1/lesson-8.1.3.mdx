## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:
- Identify the key hardware and software components needed for a robotics project.
- Understand basic principles for forming and working in a project team.
- Structure and write a clear project proposal.

## Identifying Hardware and Software Needs

Once you have your goals and requirements, you need to determine the tools you'll use to achieve them.

### Hardware Needs

What physical components does your project require?
-   **Robot Platform:** Will you use a pre-built robot (e.g., TurtleBot, JetBot), a custom-built chassis, or a robotic arm? Or will your project be simulation-only?
-   **Computation:** What computer will run your code? A laptop? A Raspberry Pi? A powerful desktop with a GPU for AI?
-   **Sensors:** What senses does your robot need? A camera for vision? A LiDAR for mapping? An IMU for balance?
-   **Actuators:** What motors, servos, or grippers are required?
-   **Other:** Power supply, cables, mounting brackets, etc.

### Software Needs

What software tools and libraries will you need?
-   **Operating System:** e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 (common for ROS 2).
-   **Robotics Framework:** ROS 2 is the framework for this course.
-   **Simulation Environment:** Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, etc. (if applicable).
-   **Key Libraries:**
    -   **Computer Vision:** OpenCV.
    -   **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow.
    -   **Navigation:** ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2).
-   **Programming Language:** Python, C++.

Creating a list of these needs early on helps ensure you have access to the right tools before you start.

## Forming a Team (If Applicable)

Many capstone projects are team-based. A well-functioning team can achieve much more than an individual, but a poorly functioning one can be a source of frustration.

**Tips for Team Success:**
1.  **Define Roles:** Who is responsible for what? Clearly defined roles prevent confusion. Common roles include:
    -   **Hardware Lead:** Responsible for physical assembly and maintenance.
    -   **Software Lead (Perception):** Focuses on sensor processing and computer vision.
    -   **Software Lead (Control/Planning):** Focuses on robot movement and decision-making.
    -   **Project Manager:** Keeps the team on track, manages deadlines, and organizes documentation.
2.  **Communicate Clearly:** Set up regular meeting times (e.g., once or twice a week) to discuss progress, roadblocks, and next steps. Use communication tools like Slack or Discord.
3.  **Use Version Control:** Use Git and a platform like GitHub from day one. This is essential for collaborative software development.

## Preparing a Project Proposal

A **project proposal** is a formal document that outlines your project for your instructor or supervisor. It communicates what you plan to do, how you plan to do it, and what you expect the outcome to be. It serves as a contract for your project.

### Simple Project Proposal Template

---

**1. Project Title:** A concise and descriptive title.
   - *Example: Autonomous Fetch-Bot using ROS 2 and Vision*

**2. Team Members:** List all members.

**3. Project Goal & Motivation (The "Why"):**
   - A short paragraph describing the high-level goal of your project and why it is an interesting or useful problem to solve.

**4. Scope and Key Outcomes (The "What"):**
   - Describe the scope of the project. What is the final, measurable outcome? What does "done" look like?
   - *Example: The robot will successfully fetch a specific, brightly colored object from a known location in a 5m x 5m room and bring it back to a base station.*

**5. Technical Approach (The "How"):**
   - Briefly describe your plan.
   - **Hardware:** List the main hardware components you will use.
   - **Software:** List the key software libraries and frameworks (ROS 2, Gazebo, OpenCV, etc.).
   - **Method:** Briefly describe your proposed algorithm or approach. (e.g., "We will use OpenCV for color detection to find the object and the ROS 2 Navigation Stack for movement...")

**6. Project Timeline (The "When"):**
   - Create a simple schedule with major milestones and deadlines.
   - *Week 1-2: Setup hardware, install software, basic robot teleoperation.*
   - *Week 3-4: Implement object detection algorithm.*
   - *Week 5-6: Integrate navigation.*
   - *...etc.*

**7. Potential Risks and Mitigation:**
   - Identify 1-2 potential problems and how you might solve them.
   - *Risk: Object detection is not reliable. Mitigation: We will ensure consistent lighting and use a brightly colored, uniquely shaped object to simplify the vision task.*

## Summary of Chapter 8.1

In this chapter, we have laid the complete groundwork for launching a successful capstone project. We started by brainstorming ideas and **choosing a project** that is both interesting and feasible. We then learned how to define clear **goals, requirements, and constraints** to give our project focus. Finally, we covered the practical steps of **identifying hardware/software needs**, working in a **team**, and structuring a formal **project proposal**. With this comprehensive plan in place, you are now ready to move on to the exciting phase of implementation, testing, and demonstration.
