## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:
- Understand the purpose and scope of a capstone project in robotics.
- Identify criteria for selecting a suitable and achievable project topic.
- Brainstorm potential project ideas based on your interests and available resources.

## Introduction: What is a Capstone Project?

Welcome to the Capstone Project unit! This is where you get to apply everything you've learned throughout this course—from ROS 2 and simulation to manipulation and AI—to a single, comprehensive project. A **capstone project** is a culminating experience that allows you to tackle a challenging problem, showcase your skills, and build something you can be proud of.

The goal is not to solve a problem that no one has ever solved before, but to demonstrate your ability to design, implement, and evaluate a complete robotic system. This is your chance to be creative, solve problems, and experience the full robotics development lifecycle.

## How to Choose a Robotics Problem

Choosing the right project is the most critical first step. A good project is one that is both **interesting** to you and **achievable** within the given timeframe and resources.

### 1. Start with Your Interests

What part of this course did you find most exciting?
-   **Locomotion:** Are you fascinated by how humanoids walk and balance?
-   **Manipulation:** Do you want to build a robot that can interact with objects?
-   **Perception:** Are you interested in using cameras and AI to help a robot "see"?
-   **Human-Robot Interaction:** Do you want to build a robot that people can talk to and command?

Your passion for the topic will be the fuel that drives you through the challenges ahead.

### 2. Consider the Scope and Constraints

It's easy to dream big, but you must be realistic about what you can achieve.
-   **Time:** You have a limited amount of time. Choose a problem that can be broken down into manageable weekly goals.
-   **Resources:** What hardware do you have access to? A physical robot? A powerful computer for simulation? If you don't have access to advanced hardware, a simulation-only project is a perfectly valid and challenging option.
-   **Complexity:** A common pitfall is choosing a project that is too complex. It's better to successfully complete a simple, well-defined project than to fail at an overly ambitious one. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and add features if you have time.

```
+--------------------+
|   Project Idea     |
+--------------------+
         |
         |
+--------v--------+   Is it interesting?
|    Interest     |----------------------> [Yes/No]
+-----------------+
         |
         |
+--------v--------+   Is it achievable?
|   Feasibility   |----------------------> [Yes/No]
| (Time, Resources)|
+-----------------+
```

### 3. Example Project Ideas

Here are a few ideas, ranging from simulation-only to those requiring some hardware, to get you thinking.

-   **Simulation-Only Projects:**
    -   **Automated Warehouse Picker:** In a Gazebo or Isaac Sim environment, create a mobile robot that can navigate to a shelf, identify a specific object (e.g., based on color or shape), and pick it up using a robotic arm.
    -   **Humanoid Obstacle Course:** Design a simulation environment with various obstacles (e.g., stairs, narrow gaps, uneven terrain) and develop a control algorithm to guide a humanoid robot through it.
    -   **Conversational Assistant:** Connect a simulated robot arm to an LLM. Allow a user to give natural language commands (e.g., "stack the red block on the blue one") and have the robot execute them in the simulation.

-   **Hardware-Light Projects (using a webcam, simple motors, etc.):**
    -   **Vision-Controlled Robotic Arm:** Build a simple 2- or 3-DoF robotic arm and use a webcam to detect an object. Write a program that guides the arm to point at or touch the detected object.
    -   **Voice-Activated Rover:** Create a simple wheeled robot and use a microphone and a Speech-to-Text service to allow voice commands like "move forward," "stop," and "turn left."

## Summary

In this lesson, we introduced the **capstone project** as your opportunity to synthesize and apply your robotics knowledge. We discussed the critical process of **choosing a project**, emphasizing the need to balance your personal interests with the realistic constraints of time and resources. Finally, we brainstormed several **example project ideas** to inspire you. The key to a successful capstone is selecting a well-defined problem that excites you and that you can realistically solve.
